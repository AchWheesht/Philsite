<title>Cult of Rationality<title>
<text>What is a cult?

<ul>
<li>According to {{merriam-webster|https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cult}}, its anything from a formal religious orginisation to a group of people wholly obsessed with something</li>
<li>Acording to {{Christianity Today|http://www.christianitytoday.com/iyf/advice/faithqa/what-is-cult.html}}, its a following which is Exclusive, Secretive and Authoritarian</li>
<li>According to {{Urban Dictionary|http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cult&defid=169012}}, its something you don’t know you’re in until the last ten minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have recently been reading Yudkowski's {{sequences||https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences}} - a series of short essays on
rationality and ratoinal ways of thinking. They're good, but they do have some interesting quotes:
""http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/|Yet one should also be careful not to overuse that word.  One receives no points merely for pronouncing it loudly.
If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.""
When I asked my friend - a Yudkowsky fan - whether he was in fact leading cult, he took a great deal of offence and talked at length
about how rationalism is very much not a cult.

This, of course, is standard cultist behaviour.

For the record, I dont believe Yudkowsky is leading a cult, or, at least, it is not a goal of his. I dont think this stops the warning signs
 being meaningful - but if rationalism is a cult, it at least seems like it would give you the tools to recognise what it is.
