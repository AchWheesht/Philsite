<title><a href="https://xkcd.com/505/">Rocks</a><title>
<text>Start with a rock.

</br>Then, a line of rocks.</br>
Next again, a much longer line.</br>
Iterate. Then suddenly...</br>

</br>Particles dashing, colliding, swerving, coming and going in the hectic dance of birth, light and heat
and speed all joining hands to produce...

</br>More rocks, longer lines, more intricate patterns.

</br>Mapping to space, gigantic swathes of space, stretching between the tiny islands of <i>stuff</i>.</br>
A different dance now, slower. The bigger bits waltz lazily round the smaller bits, which haven't yet forgotten
how it started.

</br>The rocks grow...

</br>On a small collection of bigger bits, something strange occurs.</br>
Something <i>green</i>.
Something with its own rules, its own way of working, something above the crashing and the swerving and the waltzing.

</br>The rocks grow...

</br>The new rules grow more and complicated. Until, suddenly, the rules produce new rules. </br>
The newer rules <i>build</i>.</br>
Pyramids and statues and walls and castles and mansions and trains and rockets and little stone simulators.</br>
The newer rules look, and see, and wonder.</br>
The newer rules say "I have made this".

</br>The rocks grow.
